# Data Science Final Assignment Methodology

### Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to? (2 points)

The topic I choose to apply the data science methodology to is Hospitals. It is related to my education which is Nursing.

### Next, you will play the role of the client and the data scientist. Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer. (3 marks)

### You are required to:

### 1) Describe the problem, related to the topic you selected.
### 2) Phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data

Hospitals constatnly wanted to improve patient outcomes and optimize resource usage. I'm interested in how we can reduce patient readmission rates, which often cause indadequate post-discharge care of inssufficient treatment.
What are the primary factors contributing to hospital readmission within 30 days?

### Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with. (5 marks):

### 1. Analytic Approach
### 2. Data Requirements
### 3. Data Collection
### 4. Data Understanding and Preparation
### 5. Modeling and Evaluation

### You can always refer to the labs as a reference with describing how you would complete each stage for your problem.

1. Analytical Approach

   I'd use a combination of descriptive analysis to explore relationships between readmission rates and factors like treatment type, length of stay, and patient demographics, along with predictive modeling to identify which factors most strongly predict readmission.

2. Data Requirements

   The data needed includes patient demographics, medical conditions, length of stay, treatment types, discharge instructions, and any follow-up care provided.

3. Data Collection

   Collect data from medical records department, including patient's records (EHRs), discharge notes, and follow-up records. Ensuring data privacy and complicance with health regulations (HIPAA).

4. Data Understanding and Preparation

   Analyze data distributions, check for missing values, and assess data quality. Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand relationships and prepare the data by encoding categorical variables and normalizing continuous ones.

5. Modeling and Evaluation

   Build and train predictive modles like logistic regression or decision trees to preict readmission likelihood. Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, recall, and AUC-ROC, and refine based on performance.
