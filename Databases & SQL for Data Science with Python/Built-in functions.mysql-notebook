For this query, we will use the function SUM(COLUMN_NAME). The output of this query will be the total value of all elements in the column. The query for this question can be written as:\n\nSELECT SUM(COST) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n#2.You can further assign a label to the query SUM_OF_COST.\n\nSELECT SUM(COST) AS SUM_OF_COST FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# For this query, we will use the function MAX(COLUMN_NAME). The output of this query will be the maximum value of all elements in the column. The query for this question can be written as:\n\nSELECT MAX(QUANTITY) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# The query can easily be changed to display the minimum quantity using the MIN function instead.\n\nSELECT MIN(QUANTITY) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n#3.  Write a query that displays the average cost of animals rescued.\n\nSELECT AVG(COST) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n\n# Scalar Functions and String Functions\n# 1. Write a query that displays the rounded integral cost of each rescue.\n\nSELECT ROUND(COST) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# In case the question was to round the value to 2 decimal places, the query would change to:\n\nSELECT ROUND(COST, 2) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# 2. Write a query that displays the length of each animal name.\n# For this query, we will use the function LENGTH(COLUMN_NAME). The output of this query will be the length of each element in the column. The query for this question can be written as:\n\nSELECT LENGTH(ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# 3. Write a query that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase.\n# For this query, we will use the function UCASE(COLUMN_NAME). The output of this query will be each element in the column in upper case letters. The query for this question can be written as:\n\nSELECT UCASE(ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# Just as easily, the user could ask for a lower case representation, and the query would be changed to:\n\nSELECT LCASE(ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n\n# Data Functions\n# 1. Write a query that displays the rescue date.\n# For this query, we will use the function DAY(COLUMN_NAME). The output of this query will be only the DAY part of the date in the column. The query for this question can be written as:\n\nSELECT DAY(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# In case the query was asking for MONTH of rescue, the query would change to:\n\nSELECT MONTH(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# In case the query was asking for YEAR of rescue, the query would change to:\n\nSELECT YEAR(RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrival. Write a query that displays the third day of each rescue.\n# For this query, we will use the function DATE_ADD(COLUMN_NAME, INTERVAL Number Date_element). Here, the quantity in Number and in Date_element will combine to form the interval to be added to the date in the column. For the given question, the query would be:\n\nSELECT DATE_ADD(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 3 DAY) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# If the question was to add 2 months to the date, the query would change to:\n\nSELECT DATE_ADD(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 2 MONTH) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# Similarly, we can retrieve a date before the one given in the column by a given number using the function DATE_SUB. By modifying the same example, the following query would provide the date 3 days before the rescue.\n\nSELECT DATE_SUB(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 3 DAY) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# If the question was to add 2 months to the date, the query would change to:\n\nSELECT DATE_ADD(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 2 MONTH) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# Similarly, we can retrieve a date before the one given in the column by a given number using the function DATE_SUB. By modifying the same example, the following query would provide the date 3 days before the rescue.\n\nSELECT DATE_SUB(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 3 DAY) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# Write a query that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued, for example, the difference between the current date and the rescue date.\n# For this query, we will use the function DATEDIFF(Date_1, Date_2). This function calculates the difference between the two given dates and gives the output in number of days. For the given question, the query would be:\n\nSELECT DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n# CURRENT_DATE is also an inbuilt function that returns the present date as known to the server.\n# To present the output in a YYYY-MM-DD format, another function FROM_DAYS(number_of_days)can be used. This function takes a number of days and returns the required formatted output. The query above would thus be modified to\n\nSELECT FROM_DAYS(DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, RESCUEDATE)) FROM PETRESCUE;\n\n\n# Practice Problem\n# 1. Write a query that displays the average cost of rescuing a single dog. Note that the cost per dog would not be the same in different instances.\n\nSELECT AVG(COST/QUANTITY) FROM PETRESCUE WHERE ANIMAL = 'Dog';\n\n# 2. Write a query that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase without duplications.\n\nSELECT DISTINCT UPPER(ANIMAL) FROM petrescue;\n\n# 3. Write a query that displays all the columns from the PETRESCUE table where the animal(s) rescued are cats. Use cat in lowercase in the query.\n\nSELECT * FROM petrescue\nWHERE LOWER(ANIMAL)= 'cat';\n\n# 4. Write a query that displays the number of rescues in the 5th month.\n\nSELECT SUM(QUANTITY) \nFROM petrescue\nWHERE MONTH(RESCUEDATE) = '05';\n\n# 5. The rescue shelter is supposed to find good homes for all animals within 1 year of their rescue. Write a query that displays the ID and the target date.\n\nSELECT ID, DATE_ADD(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 1 YEAR) FROM petrescue;",
